  abstract = {We present VoxelMorph, a fast learning-based framework for deformable, pairwise medical image registration. Traditional registration methods optimize an objective function for each pair of images, which can be time-consuming for large datasets or rich deformation models. In contrast to this approach, and building on recent learning-based methods, we formulate registration as a function that maps an input image pair to a deformation field that aligns these images. We parameterize the function via a convolutional neural network (CNN), and optimize the parameters of the neural network on a set of images. Given a new pair of scans, VoxelMorph rapidly computes a deformation field by directly evaluating the function. In this work, we explore two different training strategies. In the first (unsupervised) setting, we train the model to maximize standard image matching objective functions that are based on the image intensities. In the second setting, we leverage auxiliary segmentations available in the training data. We demonstrate that the unsupervised model's accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while operating orders of magnitude faster. We also show that VoxelMorph trained with auxiliary data improves registration accuracy at test time, and evaluate the effect of training set size on registration. Our method promises to speed up medical image analysis and processing pipelines, while facilitating novel directions in learning-based registration and its applications.

However, the performances of ConvNets may be limited by a lack of explicit consideration of the long-range spatial relationships in an image. Recently Vision Transformer architectures have been proposed to address the shortcomings of ConvNets and have produced state-of-the-art performances in many medical imaging applications. Transformers may be a strong candidate for image registration because their substantially larger receptive field enables a more precise comprehension of the spatial correspondence between moving and fixed images. Here, we present TransMorph, a hybrid Transformer-ConvNet model for volumetric medical image registration. This paper also presents diffeomorphic and Bayesian variants of TransMorph: the diffeomorphic variants ensure the topology-preserving deformations, and the Bayesian variant produces a well-calibrated registration uncertainty estimate. We extensively validated the proposed models using 3D medical images from three applications: inter-patient and atlas-to-patient brain MRI registration and phantom-to-CT registration. The proposed models are evaluated in comparison to a variety of existing registration methods and Transformer architectures. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed Transformer-based model leads to a substantial performance improvement over the baseline methods, confirming the effectiveness of Transformers for medical image registration.},

The recently proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification uses a purely self-attention-based model that learns long-range spatial relations to focus on the relevant parts of an image. Nevertheless, ViT emphasizes the low-resolution features because of the consecutive downsamplings, result in a lack of detailed localization information, making it unsuitable for image registration. Recently, several ViT-based image segmentation methods have been combined with ConvNets to improve the recovery of detailed localization information. Inspired by them, we present ViT-V-Net, which bridges ViT and ConvNet to provide volumetric medical image registration.

Beyond helping CNNs to handle long-range dependencies, Ramachandran et al. (2019) showed that attention can completely replace convolution and achieve state-of-the-art performance on vision tasks. This raises the question: do learned attention layers operate similarly to convolutional layers? This work provides evidence that attention layers can perform convolution and, indeed, they often learn to do so in practice. Specifically, we prove that a multi-head self-attention layer with sufficient number of heads is at least as expressive as any convolutional layer. Our numerical experiments then show that self-attention layers attend to pixel-grid patterns similarly to CNN layers, corroborating our analysis. Our code is publicly available.},

Conventional approaches refer to the definition of a similarity criterion that, once endowed with a deformation model and a smoothness constraint, determines the optimal transformation to align two given images. The definition of this metric function is among the most critical aspects of the registration process. We argue that incorporating semantic information (in the form of anatomical segmentation maps) into the registration process will further improve the accuracy of the results. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised approach to learn domain specific aggregations of conventional metrics using anatomical segmentations. This combination is learned using latent structured support vector machines (LSSVM). The learned matching criterion is integrated within a metric free optimization framework based on graphical models, resulting in a multi-metric algorithm endowed with a spatially varying similarity metric function conditioned on the anatomical structures. We provide extensive evaluation on three different datasets of CT and MRI images, showing that learned multi-metric registration outperforms single-metric approaches based on conventional similarity measures.},

To address this issues, here we present a cycle-consistent deformable image registration. The cycle consistency enhances image registration performance by providing an implicit regularization to preserve topology during the deformation. The proposed method is so flexible that can be applied for both 2D and 3D registration problems for various applications, and can be easily extended to multi-scale implementation to deal with the memory issues in large volume registration. Experimental results on various datasets from medical and non-medical applications demonstrate that the proposed method provides effective and accurate registration on diverse image pairs within a few seconds.

  abstract = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with {\textbackslash}textbf\{S\}hifted {\textbackslash}textbf\{win\}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

  abstract = {Medical image registration is a fundamental and critical task in medical image analysis. With the rapid development of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have dominated the medical image registration field. Due to the disadvantage of the local receptive field of CNN, some recent registration methods have focused on using transformers for non-local registration. However, the standard Transformer has a vast number of parameters and high computational complexity, which causes Transformer can only be applied at the bottom of the registration models. As a result, only coarse information is available at the lowest resolution, limiting the contribution of Transformer in their models. To address these challenges, we propose a convolution-based efficient multi-head self-attention (CEMSA) block, which reduces the parameters of the traditional Transformer and captures local spatial context information for reducing semantic ambiguity in the attention mechanism. Based on the proposed CEMSA, we present a novel Symmetric Transformer-based model (SymTrans). SymTrans employs the Transformer blocks in the encoder and the decoder respectively to model the long-range spatial cross-image relevance. We apply SymTrans to the displacement field and diffeomorphic registration. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in image registration.

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been recently employed to solve problems from both the computer vision and medical image analysis fields. Despite their popularity, most approaches are only able to process 2D images while most medical data used in clinical practice consists of 3D volumes. In this work we propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous methods.},

This document provides a brief and personal view of the discipline that has emerged as Machine Learning, the fundamental questions it addresses, its relationship to other sciences and society, and where it might be headed.},

  abstract = {We present a postprocessing layer for deformable image registration to make a registration field more diffeomorphic by encouraging Jacobians of the transformation to be positive. Diffeomorphic image registration is important for medical imaging studies because of the properties like invertibility, smoothness of the transformation, and topology preservation/non-folding of the grid. Violation of these properties can lead to destruction of the neighbourhood and the connectivity of anatomical structures during image registration. Most of the recent deep learning methods do not explicitly address this folding problem and try to solve it with a smoothness regularization on the registration field. In this paper, we propose a differentiable layer, which takes any registration field as its input, computes exponential of the Jacobian matrices of the input and reconstructs a new registration field from the exponentiated Jacobian matrices using Poisson reconstruction. Our proposed Poisson reconstruction loss enforces positive Jacobians for the final registration field. Thus, our method acts as a post-processing layer without any learnable parameters of its own and can be placed at the end of any deep learning pipeline to form an end-to-end learnable framework. We show the effectiveness of our proposed method for a popular deep learning registration method Voxelmorph and evaluate it with a dataset containing 3D brain MRI scans. Our results show that our post-processing can effectively decrease the number of non-positive Jacobians by a significant amount without any noticeable deterioration of the registration accuracy, thus making the registration field more diffeomorphic.

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Purpose               In this feasibility study, a phase-resolved functional lung imaging postprocessing method for extraction of dynamic perfusion (Q) and ventilation (V) parameters using a conventional 1H lung MRI Fourier decomposition acquisition is introduced.                                         Methods               Time series of coronal gradient-echo MR images with a temporal resolution of 288 to 324 ms of two healthy volunteers, one patient with chronic thromboembolic hypertension, one patient with cystic fibrosis, and one patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were acquired at 1.5 T. Using a sine model to estimate cardiac and respiratory phases of each image, all images were sorted to reconstruct full cardiac and respiratory cycles. Time to peak (TTP), V/Q maps, and fractional ventilation flow-volume loops were calculated.                                         Results               For the volunteers, homogenous ventilation and perfusion TTP maps (V-TTP, Q-TTP) were obtained. The chronic thromboembolic hypertension patient showed increased perfusion TTP in hypoperfused regions in visual agreement with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, which improved postpulmonary endaterectomy surgery. Cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients showed a pattern of increased V-TTP and Q-TTP in regions of hypoventilation and decreased perfusion. Fractional ventilation flow-volume loops of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient were smaller in comparison with the healthy volunteer, and showed regional differences in visual agreement with functional small airways disease and emphysema on CT.                                         Conclusions               This study shows the feasibility of phase-resolved functional lung imaging to gain quantitative information regarding regional lung perfusion and ventilation without the need for ultrafast imaging, which will be advantageous for future clinical translation.

Recent progress in the field of deep learning has significantly advanced the performance of medical image registration. In this review, we present a comprehensive survey on deep learning-based deformable medical image registration methods. These methods are classified into five categories: Deep Iterative Methods, Supervised Methods, Unsupervised Methods, Weakly Supervised Methods, and Latest Methods. A detailed review of each category is provided with discussions about contributions, tasks, and inadequacies. We also provide statistical analysis for the selected papers from the point of view of image modality, the region of interest (ROI), evaluation metrics, and method categories. In addition, we summarize 33 publicly available datasets that are used for benchmarking the registration algorithms. Finally, the remaining challenges, future directions, and potential trends are discussed in our review.},
