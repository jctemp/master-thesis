  width: 100%,
  radius: 10%,
  stroke: 0.5pt,
  fill: yellow,
)[
  Note: Summarize the most interesting results of your evaluation (without interpretation). Additional results can be put into the appendix.

  Note: Interpret the results and conclude interesting findings
]

== Discussion

  fill: yellow,
)[
  Note: Discuss the findings in more detail and also review possible disadvantages that you found
]

  fill: yellow,
)[
  Note: Describe limitations and threats to validity of your evaluation, e.g. reliability, generalizability, selection bias, researcher bias
]

= Summary
#rect(

  radius: 10%,
  stroke: 0.5pt,
  fill: yellow,
)[
  Note: This chapter includes the status of your thesis, a conclusion and an outlook about future work.
]

== Status
#rect(
  width: 100%,
  radius: 10%,
  stroke: 0.5pt,
  fill: yellow,
)[
  Note: Describe honestly the achieved goals (e.g. the well implemented and tested use cases) and the open goals here. if you only have achieved goals, you did something wrong in your analysis.
]

=== Realized Goals
#rect(
  width: 100%,
  radius: 10%,
  stroke: 0.5pt,
  fill: yellow,
)[
  Note: Summarize the achieved goals by repeating the realized requirements or use cases stating how you realized them.
]

=== Open Goals
#rect(
  width: 100%,
  radius: 10%,
  stroke: 0.5pt,
  fill: yellow,
)[
  Note: Summarize the open goals by repeating the open requirements or use cases and explaining why you were not able to achieve them. Important: It might be suspicious, if you do not have open goals. This usually indicates that you did not thoroughly analyze your problems.
]

== Conclusion
#rect(
  width: 100%,
  radius: 10%,
  stroke: 0.5pt,
  fill: yellow,
)[
  Note: Recap shortly which problem you solved in your thesis and discuss your *contributions* here.
]

== Future Work
