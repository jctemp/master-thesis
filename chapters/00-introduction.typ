= Introduction <ch-introduction>
// As aforementioned, the thesis tackles the problem of registration for a lung image series.
// The currently used tool is the advanced normalisation tool @avantsAdvancedNormalizationTools.
// However, it has the drawback of being significantly slower than deep learning alternatives @fuDeepLearningMedical2019 @chenTransMorphTransformerUnsupervised2021.
// Medicine is a continuously developing area that benefits from advancements in computer science.
// More computational capacity, enabling more complex and expensive operations, allowed the integration of computer-aided technologies in everyday clinical practice.
// Furthermore, the rapid development in machine learning creates new opportunities for researchers to introduce novel or optimise current state-of-the-art methods to increase efficiency in any aspect of computer-aided medicine.

// In the past decades, computer vision has become increasingly sophisticated due to the renaissance of convolutional neural networks (AlexNet, ResNet and Inception) and their achievements, replacing conventional state-of-the-art methods.
// In addition to image classification, convolutional neural networks are used for more advanced use cases like object detection, semantic segmentation, and image registration.
// Besides the change in computer vision, the transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention is all need", became central to natural language processing (NLP).
// A slight modification reintroduced the transformer concept to computer vision with the name vision transformer, surpassing many convolutional neural networks.

// Computer vision is essential in medical imaging because object detection, semantic segmentation, and image registration are often required.
// Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a standard method used in clinical practice and is significant for many disciplines @reviewA because MR images are well-suited to examine various anatomical features.
// In addition, it does not require ionising radiation, which is a factor to consider if examining a patient.

// For this master's thesis, we will work with a novel method called phase-resolved functional lung (PERFUL) MR imaging @Voskrebenzev2017.
// It utilises MR lung images to compute regional perfusion and ventilation of the lung whilst not requiring radioactive tracers or patients to hold their breath.
